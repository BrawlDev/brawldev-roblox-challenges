## TEMPORAL FORMAT

## Task

- Make a Snake game, it should be able to eat apples to get bigger. It should die if it touched its body.

## Requirements

- It should be in 3D (like, not in a gui)
- It should be able to reset the game
- It should be able to eat apples to get bigger
- You have to make a **dead screen** with these options:
  - **Leave game**: This kicks the player
  - **Try Again**: This restarts the game and starts the game again
- The dead screen should show this information
  - Snake size
  - Round duration
  - Best record (best snake size)
- You should add sounds effects (optional)
- The map should have limits, if the snake touches those limits, it dies
- The apple should appear randomly inside the map

## Extra Notes

- The code must be readable
- The code should have comments explaining your code well
- You CAN NOT use third-party modules to make this challenge easier, it has to be pure luau

> Also, you will have to publish the game to roblox and make it uncopylocked so i can see if your code is correct (optional)

## Optional tasks

Make different maps, make a speedrun mode, make a top player leaderboard that shows the players with the biggest snake size (it sounds weird lol)
